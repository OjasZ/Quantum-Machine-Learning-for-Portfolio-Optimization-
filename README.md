# Quantum Machine Learning for Portfolio Optimization

This project explores the application of quantum computing and machine learning techniques to optimize investment portfolios in finance. By leveraging quantum computing frameworks such as Qiskit and TensorFlow Quantum, along with classical machine learning libraries, the project aims to develop quantum-enhanced portfolio optimization algorithms for improved risk-adjusted returns.

## Overview

Quantum machine learning offers the potential to revolutionize portfolio optimization by harnessing the unique properties of quantum mechanics to handle large-scale financial data and complex optimization objectives more efficiently. This project investigates various quantum machine learning algorithms and hybrid optimization techniques for portfolio management, with the goal of achieving superior performance compared to classical approaches.

## Key Features

- Quantum feature mapping for encoding financial data into quantum states.
- Quantum variational optimization for portfolio risk minimization and return maximization.
- Hybrid classical-quantum optimization techniques for enhanced performance.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for financial datasets.
- Model evaluation and performance analysis using backtesting and simulation.
